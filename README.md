`file-sage` is a modular Go application for managing digital content scattered across disparate cloud services and local storage.

# Purpose and Motivation
This project was inspired by my need to analyze and coalesce the vast digital diaspora of photos, videos, documents, and code stored "all over the place". 

The evolution and proliferation of cloud and open-source storage and web technologies over the past few decades has made it easy and ever-cheaper to automate backups of the digital content from our devices.

The same technical and market forces that drove the commoditization of cloud storage unfortunately had the negative effect of creating proprietary siloes around ones data, designed to lock the customer into a vendor's ecosystem.

I suspect that such poor digital stewardship is commonplace, but have been surprised by the apparent lack of open-source or proprietary projects to solve this problem.
